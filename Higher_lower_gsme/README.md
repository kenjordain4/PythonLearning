**Higher or Lower Game

This program is an interactive game where the player tries to guess which of two 
celebrities or accounts has more followers.

The game works as follows:

1. Randomly selects two accounts from a dataset containing names, descriptions, 
   and follower counts.
2. Displays the names and descriptions to the player without showing the follower counts.
3. The player guesses which account has a higher number of followers.
4. If the player guesses correctly:
    - Their score increases by 1.
    - The second account becomes the first account for the next round.
    - A new second account is randomly selected (different from the first).
5. If the player guesses incorrectly, the round ends and the final score is shown.
6. After each game, the player can choose to play again or exit.

This game teaches comparison, keeps track of the score, and provides a fun interactive 
way to test knowledge of popular accounts and celebrities.
